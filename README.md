# JavaGameDesign
Provides simple code for implementing versions of PacMan, Connect Four, Tic Tac Toe, and Flappy Bird.

These games are meant for instructional use and to play around with. They were created with the purpose of 
introducing students to simple data structures and event handling code. It is assumed they know simple loops
and how to create new objects.
Each game addresses movement, datas structures, object creation, win/lose states, and graphic design.

Tic Tac Toe is designed as an Android app and uses corresponding CSS/HTML.
